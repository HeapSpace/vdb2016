      - "When I joined a very large client in the Banking sector with a lot of history in IT, just to discover that they actually had no corporate guidelines to follow so that we had to establish the entire technical stack from scratch. We actually had to spend countless nights to explore the best approach to so many concerns. What we weren't realizing at that time bowever was that we were actually establishing the new 'de facto 'standards for then onwards. Once the project became a sound success, tens of projects starting 'inspiring' from our approach. Bottom line: do your best, whatever the challenge your are faced with. If you do it right, you can't ever suspect its potential impact up-front."

      - "Back in the 90s, with my first family PC, and discovering for the first time that I could call my cousin's computer with Command & Conquer. It had a multiplayer option where you literally entered a phone number to dial another computer. It was my first PC, and before my house had proper internet. I remember being amazed at seeing what he typed appear on my screen. We played it all night, and every night for a week or so, until the phone bill arrived. I still remember the look on my father's face."
      - "With more and more congestion in cities, and property prices spiralling seemingly endlessly upwards in tech hotspots (San Francisco just being one example), I see remote work becoming a mainstream thing. Internet speeds are now fast enough to make video chat a more than viable option, and the tools available for working remotely are far more mature these days. It makes sense for the employee, with less commutes and less distractions when working, but it also makes sense for employers - they can look outside their immediate area in the search for the best talent."
      - "Don't be afraid to ask questions for fear of appearing dumb. Asking questions is the smartest thing you can do, especially in your early years as a developer. Keep asking until you understand what you want to know. In the software industry, this is the fastest way to learn - more so than in other industries."

      - "When working on a very old system, I suspected that a big part of it has no use and is maintained only out of fear that removing those programs will break something. One day, without telling anyone, I logged into the production system and removed all the suspects (around 25 of them). It turned out that those services were, indeed, not used. Ten years later, the customer still thinks that those services are running."
      - "Just like hardware, everything will be smaller and smaller. We'll build smaller services (microservices, lambdas, etc), we'll work in smaller teams, and we'll use smaller (more specific) tools. As a result, smaller companies will prevail over big corporations. All that will be followed by more automation. It is a software equivalent of the industrial revolution. Machines (scripts) will take over a big chunk of what we do. Some professions will become obsolete or greatly reduced in numbers (manual testing, operations, and so on). Only creative (non-repetitive) jobs will stay."
      - "Dear younger me. During the beginning of 2000, you'll be offered a job in a big corporation. Do not, under any circumstance, accept it. I cannot tell you the name of the company except that it starts with G and ends with Tech."

      - "This is an especially tough one! Probably at the top of the list is the grueling flight testing required when programming my airborne drone to fly autonomously. Since the drone was to operate *fully* autonomously, there was no way to take back control (early on) until the drone completed its flight plan. Since flight testing was done indoors - in our living room - this led to many unfortunate flights that endangered drapes, furniture, & house plants...and even targeted my ever-patient wife and me at times (hazards of being the flight testers!). It was NOT a pretty sight. Fortunately, the drone, living room, & even my marriage survived. :D"
      - "Exciting! The pace of change and innovation is only increasing, and the future holds so much promise. I can't wait!"
      - "Avoid vendor-specific, non-open technologies at all cost. Vendor-led is fine if OSS, but lock-in is as real for developers as it is for organizations...and it benefits neither. If a company isn't open to change, openness, and using the 'right tool for the job', waste no time, move on *immediately*. And... Relish change! Some complain about the constant and accelerating change in our industry. Don't! It can be exhausting at times to be sure, but the opportunity to continually learn is one that some people never get. Embrace it, enjoy it, be grateful for it. And do it with your whole self! To learn is to grow. :)"

If I think for a moment about how many people I've met virtually (and then, sometimes, even personally)...I'm blown away. It's impressive how much I've shared, learned and build thanks to tech with people geographically thousands miles away from me."
      - "In my field (VR) you can't predict which hardware/software/applications will be invented in the next 6 months, for this reason I don't have any answer to this question. But one thing is sure: 5 years for tech are not 5 years for anything else."

      - "I am always quite enthusiastic about technology which can augment our own skills, be it physically as ell as virtually. Arthur C. Clarke once famously remarked that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Just the other day I had a call with an associate in Australia. It may seem trivial, but just realizing I was literally talking with someone on the other side of the earth made this feel like one of these magic moments."
      - "I don't think it is about the next 5 years. To make progress as humanity we have to focus on how our tools can have an impact that lasts longer than just the next iteration of a new technology. Marshall McLuhan once famously said 'we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us'. We have to come up with better ways to collaborate, better metaphors, better tools and paradigms. That process will last longer than 5 years."

      - "It’s hard to say. Things somehow become too ordinary when you know how they work and are able to overthink everything about them. I’d say one of the craziest things that happened to me was creating a small Adobe Flash game in 2008 and showing to everyone at school. It was my first app that actually had a GUI and, in some ways, the first real “product” that I created. I remember being a bit embarrassed to share it with the world, as well as being very happy to be treated like a genius at school. I had kids, whom I've never met, texting me that they loved playing the game and adding their ideas on how to make it more fun."
      - "There’re quite a few things that I am excited about in the coming 5–10 years: AI research, the rise of autonomous vehicles, biotech, space travel research etc. While I don’t think that 5 years will be enough for any of these techs to disrupt our life or change the world completely, I believe that that this will be the time when important foundations will be set. I find that exciting, as it is a great time to be a pioneer in these fields."

      - "Difficult to say; given mainstream programming is still struggling to understand software development ideas from 40 years ago, I'd say not much will fundamentally change. Functional Programming will slowly grow in popularity. For better or for worse, JavaScript will still be dominant. If I am allowed some wishful thinking, I would hope that medicine and gene editing move into the focus of more OSS developers. Watch the space around CRISPR. It could change the world."

It's not all about technical skills though; my first employer only kept me after my initial two-week trial not because I was any good at programming (I wasn't), but because I was enthusiastic and made everyone cups of coffee in the mornings."

As for my personal experiences, one of my favourites is when at a previous company we locked out ourselves of our servers in China (with an incorrect firewall rule) and had to instruct a Chinese colleague via skype on how to fix it, despite he did speak very little English and did know nothing about linux. It took several hours and was quite grotesque."

Communication is already transforming, I hope video (and thus Ustream) will play an important role in this.

      - "Nowadays, tech is integral part of our lives so I can’t recall anything in newer past that could qualify here. I guess that after some time you start to take a lot of things for granted, so this was a difficult one. But there was one experience in high school when I was visiting one tech university in Germany. In one moment we were entering an elevator in new building that was leaning towards old one in order to get three stories underground. And in blink of an eye after doors closed, I felt strong pulling force and doors opened: we were there. Later I heard that in that time students were prototyping high speed elevator mechanism to be used in 50 story building. It was really crazy to feel all that force when only travelling 3 stories, and thought my brain was blown out, my stomach wasn’t so keen to go for another ride J."
      - "I really hope we would experience some new game changer until 2021. In my opinion, last was introduction of touch screen, and it really found way to everyday use in no time. Some are speaking of cloud, some about Virtual Reality, and others about Internet of Things. But I really hope that next really big thing would be beneficial for everyone, and that it wouldn’t be some fancy tech stuff that is too expensive for most of us. So my high hopes are in favor of free internet in cities and places in world where internet and information is inaccessible. Also, cheaper transportation and higher share of electrical and hybrid cars can be game changer for all of us, and this kind of tech in already in our reach, we just need to work hard to make it more affordable."
      - "As I am still very young, I doubt that time travelling right now would be very beneficial: there is really not much to say to a teenager worrying about simple every day stuff like grades and girls J But even that teenager wanted do something that lot of people could see and use, so good for him. Only advice I would give him is the advice that I am trying to give this 25 year old guy right now: slow down sometimes. Take the moment. Enjoy coffee in peace. Enjoy in simple and small things. Take a day off to spend it with your family. Because pursuing your dreams and carrier, especially nowadays in crowded world is taking more and more from us, and sometimes we don’t even notice that."

      - "I was lucky that lot of things has happen during my 20+ years of experience but the two that I would like to emphasize are:  - One man on one island create a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity with an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Ruby is ranked among the top 10 on most of the indices that measure the growth and popularity of programming languages worldwide (such as the TIOBE index). Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Ruby on Rails web framework.  - 'The Ugly Duckling' is a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen (1805 – 1875). The story tells of a homely little bird born in a barnyard who suffers abuse from the others around him until, much to his delight (and to the surprise of others), he matures into a beautiful swan, the most beautiful bird of all. The story of JavaScript / NodeJS is the same as this fairy tale."
      - "In the years to come the main thing will be avalanche of sensor data, new ways to connect them in information and new business based on new information flow.  In the same time, the switch of work force will also happen. There will be lot of developers transition from other industries performing a work that nowadays is consider complex, where it will be mostly boilerplate in a couple of years. Internet of Things will finally become a everyday thing based on only one thing - the data."
      - "Hype is usually a big boys payed marketing. The only sure thing is the change."

      - "Haunted Linux: I once wanted to switch over to Linux. I was working on a Scala/Java project and Windows+Eclipse was slowing me down. So, I thought to myself: 'Others are using Ubuntu and IDEA, perhaps I should, too'. So, I installed Linux. SUSE Linux. Which was my doom. Java compiler started reporting syntax errors on completely OK code. 'Hmm, maybe there is something buggy in that OpenJDK, let's try Sun JDK'. Sun JDK reported syntax errors in different parts of code than OpenJDK. And Eclipse was reporting also syntax errors in a completely different part of the project. EPILOGUE: I returned to Windows and lost 3 days."

Also, I think we will see some significant investments into the Eastern markets such as China and India. On the Data Science side, with the popularization of deep learning frameworks, I expect to see more and more data scientists in gaming companies sharing their experiences with implementing deep neural networks to replace the more common models. I would say similar things apply for the tech industry in general, the breakthrough of VR/AR and the continued rise of machine learning."

There will be also a shift and new interest into cloud and container orchestration technologies.

The rate of change is accelerating at an incredible pace, and not all of the pivotal technologies that will get us there have been invented yet. The predictable stuff like cloud and IoT isn’t really worthy of note at this point.  For me, it’s more about our ability to react to changes and our outlook on the world than any specific new technologies per se, and I strongly believe that organizations that think this way will win over those that don’t."

      - "Couple of years ago, when I opened Google maps to look for the location of an airport and noticed that my flight date was displayed above the airport! On its own, it may not be crazy, but I was really amazed when I saw it for the first time. It was probably at that moment that I also accepted the fact that Google knows 'everything' about me and it is up to them to decide how and where they will use that data. Isn't that crazy?"
      - "In the next 5 years, I would expect that lines the between the real and virtual world will become blurrier, and that similar progress will happen between the artificial and human intelligence. I can see advancement within those two fields redefining the world around us by 2022."

Next, it will dig deeper into all the components and explain open source projects that implement them. For example, we will see what are field gateways and how Eclipse Kura project implements those functionalities. IoT server connector's role will be described next and we'll see how Eclipse Hono helps connecting devices to the cloud. Finally, we'll examine an architecture of the IoT Cloud and see what it takes to handle and manage large number of devices. We’ll see how all IoT cloud concepts are defined and implemented in Eclipse Kapua project.After this session, you'll have the big picture of how to connect devices to the cloud in scalable way and what open source projects to use to achieve that."

Among all these topics, by far the most important topic, that I always include in all my training sessions is 'Clean Code'. It's essential to be able to keep 'alive' 100k-2M lines of code. And I was told that this module has the biggest impact in day-to-day life of the dev."
      - "Also, this talk will also show how a professional developer should behave in code, the 'ethics code' that ough to be followed by everyone. We will go from the most basic concerns like how should we choose our names, how should we write our functions, format and (not) comment them, to more advanced topics of true Objects. The entire presentation is spiced with numerous esay to understand examples and code snippets."

      - "The primary value of software is to be flexible. The secondary value of software is to do what business wants it to do."
      - "Sounds insane? Just think a bit: what's the difference between IT and regular engineering? What propulsated IT that much? The ability to evolve, to adapt to new business needs. And we all know how difficult it is to adapt and strech old, dirty, rigid code."
      - "Financially, the fact that 80% of the costs of a software project are in maintenance may not concern you, the developer, directly. But the fact that you read 10x times more time than you write code should make it clear to you: do your very best to write clean, beautiful code that is easy to understand and maintain. This talk explains how write such art."
      - "Besides the bare writing of code, the talk will touch on the problematic of team work, code responsibility and cooperation, necessary to any professional software engineer."
      - "This talk reviews the most important practical guidelines from the reference book 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin, as they proved essential in so many situations of my experience."
      - "This is the central topic of any corporate trainings I hold, and the best module of my training portfolio. The ideas that we'll discuss together are most likely to have a deep impact on your day-to-day work, changing the way you think and write software."

When they are software units, the smaller they are, the easier it is for them to self-heal, recuperate from failures, multiply or even get destroyed when that is needed. We call those small units microservices, and they can indeed have behaviours similar to those observed in a human body.  Microservices-based systems can be made in a way that they have the ability to self-heal. That is not to say that self-healing we are about to explore is applicable only to microservices. It is not. However, self-healing can be applied to almost any type of the architecture but provides best results when combined with microservices."

From there on we'll move from requirements, technological choices and development environment setup, through coding and testing all the way until the final deployment to production. We won't stop there. Once our new services are up and running we'll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, recuperate them in case of failures and create central monitoring and notifications system. We'll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible."

Brake monolithic application into smaller independent services. That's it. That is what many think microservices are about. However, implementation is much harder to master. There are many things to consider when embarking down this path. How do we organize microservices? Which technologies to use and how? Should they be mutable or not? How to test them? How to deploy them? How to create scalable and fault tolerant systems? Self-healing, zero-downtime and logging? How should the teams be organized? Today's successful implementations of microservices require all those and many other questions to be answered. It's not only about splitting things into smaller pieces. The whole development ecosystem needs to be changed and we need to take a hard look at the microservices development lifecycle."

    track: 2
    slot: 6
    short:
      - "VR is not just a 'cutting edge technology' but also a medium capable to immerse the viewer/player in another dimension and convey strong emotions. How to do so in the right way? Which techniques and tools content creators can use to convey such feelings? If the cinematic medium has a 'language', what's about VR? How to create contents with awareness?"
    long:
      - "Since Virtual Reality is still a developing concept, we are at that stage I would call the 'democratization of the discovery.' Everyone could have access to this technology and all could potentially contribute to its accomplishment. I, therefore, felt an urge to be involved with this project, trying to explore some of the aspects of this new and exciting technological breakthrough. However, the entertainment aspect of Virtual Reality, especially the way it allows storytelling is what attracts me the most to this product. That said if you tell a story as though you would in the film, you would soon meet problems, which would raise doubts and queries. It seems that applying the general audio-visual ‘rules’ achieved whilst watching a film or any other audio-visual content is not possible. One must take into consideration new factors which require ample research focused on studying and synthesizing a new language, a language that is specific and adequate to VR technology."
      - "This paper, therefore, aims to explore as deeply as possible, with the entail means and limitations, what are the ‘semantic factors’, the ‘vocabulary’, the ‘techniques’ that can elevate VR from just an advanced technological product to a real communication means. To do this, it was necessary to keep in mind the language closest to that of VR, the cinematic one. Thanks to the use of specific texts, alongside the knowledge in the appearance of audio-visual content acquired both through my academic career and through literature, it was possible to decipher the language used in VR, often comparing it to the one used in film. It was necessary to determine which 'words' you could translate into Virtual Reality directly, the ones which needed adjustments and finally the words which ultimately could not be translated at all. "
      - "In parallel to this translation, it was also crucial to pay close attention to all the features that made Virtual Reality a means of communication in its own right, those factors that characterized VR and gave it an identity of its own. It was further important to ‘test’ a large number of experiences currently available to understand what these various creators of VR experiences did to convey certain emotions and meanings to their audience. In the same way, it’s been extremely useful to listen and see what these c reators expressed during the main events focused on VR like the ‘Oculus Connect’ and ‘SVVR Expo’, thanks to video sharing platforms like YouTube. Support from the study Bully! Entertainment was essential. It allowed me to use all their equipment at the forefront of Virtual Reality and at the same time gave me the opportunity to 'Narrative Language of Virtual Reality' Aimone Bodini analyze qualitatively VR experiences through the exchange of opinions and thoughts with professionals within the studio."
      - "This research is divided into two main parts. Initially, the reader is given an introduction to the historical context of VR, briefly explaining the advancements in this technology to date as well as introducing the key figures within this field. The first part analyzes the literature available, explaining the methodology of this research and the tools that will be used to define VR language. The second part starts with a brief explanation of the human eye, how stereoscopy works, defining what is the field of view and how these features are fundamental for VR. Subsequently, the focus will shift towards the main feature of VR, or the so-called sense of 'presence' explaining the meaning and requirements necessary to create it. "
      - "The relationship with characters in Virtual Reality must also be understood and is discussed throughout as it changes the relationship that they establish with the audience is different to that through mediums such as literature or cinema. Exploring how editing works in this field is also detrimental to understanding what can be translated from the cinematic field and where new ways must be devised in terms of 'Cutting' that VR allows. The technology specific to VR is also described, in terms of both the 3 and 6 degrees of freedom, as well as explaining how it can be used creatively for narrative purposes from editing to interacting with the environment and characters. The exploration of this newly discovered language that the world hides behind single details and this topic of research requires much broader and deeper research that what was initially thought. What has been explored here is a first step in decoding the narrative language in Virtual Reality, which just scraped the tip of the iceberg. This is an important step in encouraging other researchers and scholars to demystify this area. Overall, this research is proof that VR has a language of its own and demonstrates that the knowledge of this language is fundamental to convey the correct emotions and to fully immerse the user in Virtual Reality.

The phone, calculators, cameras, games, music and video players. All of which at the date of release have cost more than a phone itself, when it first entered the market. Today's ubiquitous graphical user interface has its roots in concepts dating back to the mid-'60s. These concepts were then further developed at XEROX Parc in the '70s, and successfully commercialized in the Apple Macintosh in the early '80s, whereupon they essentially froze. "

Chatbots will be one of the next big evolutions of mobile messengers and they are changing the way how users interact with a service. People are downloading fewer apps, and bots within messengers are quickly becoming a new way to enrich these platforms with context from outside. Messengers like WeChat already showed how to build a truly mobile platform with a pioneering model of 'apps within an app'. Adding a chatbot has a way lower barrier for users, since there’s no need to go to an appstore and download an app, it can just be added as a contact. This is super effective for lower-frequency but important services like managing credit card statements, utility bills or recurring shop orders. For these use cases, chatbots are a perfect fit since adding the bot is extremely lightweight instead of downloading a separate native full-featured apps."
      - "Chatbots unify the UI and the interaction with a service even more than mobile apps do. They have the potential to be easier to use and learnings to be transferred from one to the other. Users do not have to learn the UI from scratch because they are already familiar with the core UI and interaction concepts from chatting with other people."

Perhaps you have read that a REPL is useful for 'playing around' or for 'small code snippets', but this is far from true. In this presentation, you will learn how with a REPL you can have a better and more productive developer workflow by building a Tomcat service, one bit at a time, without having to build, compile, package or deploy it. Demo will be done with a Clojure REPL but no previous experience with Clojure is needed."

Using TDD somehow ease the pain as the number of times that you need to recompile/repackage/redeploy as often, but there are still lots of code/configuration that cannot be tested unless you start the whole application. Also to be able to do TDD, you first need to understand how APIs (libraries/restful services) will behave and what kind of data they will return."

Servers are on fire, exceptions are flooding the logs, and your customers are taking their frustration to Twitter. What do you do?"
      - "Every company that succeeds (and that's what we're all aiming for, right?) will have to solve this problem eventually. We'll talk about how Yammer evolved from having just a single person as 'the' on-call engineer, to a cross-geo follow-the-sun on-call team that satisfies customer needs, meets Microsoft standards, and doesn't kill engineers. You'll leave this talk with tips on what worked and what didn’t, to help you build this process for your team."

Best part is that it keeps getting shorter with each iteration. A big feature used to take us 45 days to develop. Releasing a feature of equivalent complexity now takes about three weeks on average. This is from the start until the moment a finished product is available to the customer (only DoD that matters to us). It includes kick-off, development, testing, code review, documentation, staging, release and announcement. From our perspective, that’s a 100% increase in productivity. We accomplished it with the same resources and people - the only difference being constant retrospectives and improvement of the way we work."

To most developers the technology is tangential to the business they work in, and is often disregarded with much hand waving as “just a pipe” for message distribution. Without a clear understanding of their capabilities and underlying design decisions, we imagine myths about how these systems “should” work and are frustrated in production by behaviours emerging from their design trade-offs."

We need better tools. We need our machines to automatically verify the fundamental correctness of our systems. These tools have been around for a while, but until recently the 'Getting Started' material has been thin on the ground. In this talk I will show you how to get up and running and ready to build stuff with a Rails-like framework underpinned by one of the fastest and most stable languages in the industry: Haskell. The talk will cover everything from setting up a development environment, to integrating with a database and deploying to a VPS.

Then came the lambda architecture that brought a lot of new concepts on how data is stored and analyzed in near-real-time. Todays standards require us to analyze data in real-time so that we can react accordingly and gain insights as the data is streamed into our system."
    long:
      - "Traditional data warehousing and data analytics was an offline job and it usually required a lot of time to complete and give some results. These operations gave us some insight into our business but we had a limited possibility to improve or react in a timely manner. One of the efforts to move this approach closer to real-time was described with Lambda architecture where raw data was stored in real-time while also being analyzed in parallel and producing results with a certain delay. This approach eliminated those long running jobs by preparing analytic results on the incoming data but in todays business right information at the right time can mean improving our business and directly leading to more profit. Our latest technologies give us possibility to execute analytics on data streams and react almost instantly. Faster data requires faster reactions especially if its a fraud detection or a mission critical system. NoETL philosophy explains why the traditional approach is no longer valid and why we need these new technologies that we have today. In this presentation we are going to talk about the evolution from monolithic to distributed systems, pros and cons of both approaches and what we are able to do with todays technologies. Our main focus is going to be fast data stack (Spark, Mesos, Akka, Cassandra, Kafka) and how using these technologies we can create scalable and fast data pipeline while running real-time data analytics."

While using streams, you will focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW and WHEN. The talk is divided into 3 parts. In the first part you will learn how to create a frontend of the Snake web game using streams as building blocks. Then, we will move to the server side and use Scala and Akka Stream library to create backend service that will allow the game to be played by multiple players. In the third part, we will discuss reactive streams and how they make asynchronous communication safe. "

After a general introduction, it gets down into more specific details of the project that need to be addressed: two months deployment cycle, extremely long start-up time, huge amount of responsibilities... And then breaks them down into smaller, more approachable problems. Once the problems have been reduced to something that can be handled, the talk approaches possible solutions."

Why are these solutions chosen over others? Sometimes for its quality, sometimes it's chosen due to certain constrains like time, resources, adaptability... Reasons for each of them are the centre of the talk. Finalising the talk, there is a comparison between how the project looked at the beginning and how it behaves after all the improvements."

Nowadays, people want to sit back in their couch, relax, and be able to do things that can be done on computers and smartphones, just on a large screen. From watching YouTube videos, sharing and posting on Facebook, or following latest trends on twitter, creators of Smart TV applications are struggling to make this possible and accessible by using only few remote controller buttons. Different solutions that enable user to interact with most popular internet services today, from Android and Apple TV, to standard Smart TVs are not available to everyone. Our wish was to bring this technology to every home that has domestic IPTV service. So, we rolled up our sleeves, took a leap into JavaScript world of different API’s, optimizations for TV box embedded operating systems, limitations of hardware, and interface specifics, and delivered a product that can match today’s most modern solutions in TV applications. This is our success story, one that tells how we took 80$ TV box, and put Facebook, twitter and YouTube inside it."

In implementation we will do short summary of all APIs needed for development, concentrating on explanation of key parts of code like login and authorization, data fetching, presentation of content, and posting users actions and feedback.

Despite this, web developers often tend to forget that a browser is a piece of software that has deliberately been designed as a remote code execution engine, which is the dream spec for any attacker. The focus of this talk is to explain how some of the newly introduced headers (HSTS, HPKP, CSP) can help to easily add an extra layer of security in order to defend your web apps against common web security vulnerabilities."
    long:
      - "Security flaws on websites are very widespread and depending on the nature of the website can lead to severe consequences. One of the reason why securing web apps can be challenging is that many security aspects such as client side security, transport security and server side security have to be considered during design, implementation and operation. Another fundamental problem of the web is the web browser that has deliberately been designed as remote code execution engine which is the dream platform for any attacker wanting, for instance, to inject malicious code either by exploiting an Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability or by mounting a man-in-the-middle attack. Since a browser executes JavaScript and HTML on the fly with 'almost' no security checks it is important to be able to identify the origin of the content and to take advantage of the available means to restrict how the browser executes the web app. This is exactly what this talk is about! I will start with brief overview about what is wrong with the web and especially with web browsers. Then I will explain why secure transport is so important and point out the different guarantees that HTTPS provides, such as confidentiality, authenticity and integrity and why there is no valid reason for not using it over HTTP. I will show you how to get a free certificate for your website and how to test the HTTPS configuration. The main focus of this talk are the newly introduced headers, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) and Content Security Policy (CSP). I will explain how HSTS and HPKP help to harden HTTPS against various attacks but also present the best practices for avoiding the common pitfalls. I will continue by explaining CSP and its capabilities, such as preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Clickjacking attacks. I will also give best practices about deriving the CSP policies without having negative side effects on your website and present tools that will make your CSP journey as easy as pie. All the aforementioned headers offer security “for free” in the defence of your web apps so start using them today!"

    type: 'talk'
    day: 3
    track: 2
    slot: 6
    short:
      - "Enterprise apps are mainly built upon layered architecture. Each layer only speaks to its below layer, and data among layers are shared via persistent domain objects. However, employing same domain objects in each layer causes some problems. Data might be modified unintentionally in which an ORM tool or a UI framework like JSF is used. Binding domain objects with UI fields directly creates a mess inside domain classes because of UI only fields added. To prevent such problems, it's better to employ a separate model, specific to the UI layer. Such a separate model is employed to convert data obtained from back, and deliver it to the UI layer for presentation. UI components are bound to view model objects so that user input is first accumulated into those objects and delivered to back when appropriate. However, creating such a view model mainly overlaps with persistent domain model, and job of handling data transformations between two model is a tedious task. We propose a solution based on dynamic proxies to create view model classes automatically and an API to handle various tasks occur during those data transformations. We will present our solution and discuss about the API evolved over time."
    long:
      - "In todays world, layered architecture is a very common approach among enterprise applications. Each layer has a specific task of its own, and each one is only allowed to speak just one below. For example, data access layer deals with querying and persistence of data, service layer coordinates business operations and interacts with data access layer, presentation layer handles rendering of suitable user interface as well as processing user requests while talking with service layer. In this picture, data transfer throughout the layers is achieved using domain objects. For example, data is fetched from target datastore, then transformed into domain objects in data access layer, and delivered to the presentation layer for rendering purposes. In a similar way, domain objects bound to UI are filled with user input, then passed into backend layers for processing."
      - "However, employing same domain classes in every layer can cause some data related problems in those applications. One might see that data might get inserted, updated or deleted unintentionally, especially when an ORM tool, like Hibernate is used for persisting data, UI frameworks like JSF or Vaadin, in which state management is handled on server side, while domain objects are directly bound to user interface components, used to collect user input and deliver it to the backend. Moreover, employing domain objects UI interaction might cause several fields and methods which are only needed by presentation layer get added into them. For example, adding a selected field and its corresponding getter/setter is a very common issue in order to identify which rows are selected in a UI table. That 'selected' property has nothing to the with the domain model at all."
      - "In order to prevent such data integrity problems, and keep domain classes clean from UI specific attributes and methods, one needs to create and use a separate model targeted to the presentation layer. It may appear with different names, like 'data transfer object', 'data value object' or 'view model' in different projects, and whatever you call it for, its main duty is to prevent direct interaction and manipulation of domain objects via user interface components."
      - "Although, we take it as a separate model, view model classes mostly overlap with domain model classes. Indeed, domain model classes can easily be transformed into view model classes with some additions of fields and methods. Actually, it becomes a burden for developers to just create and use a second set of model classes which are almost identical to domain model.
      We propose a solution to automatically derive those view model classes from domain model classes using proxy pattern, and define an API to handle various data related tasks which occur while transforming domain objects into view model objects, apply those user changes occurred in those view model objects during UI interaction back again to domain instances etc. With the help of such an automatic view model creation mechanism, task of creating view model classes manually becomes unnecessary. In addition, view model – domain model back and forth transformations and data related operations can be performed easily through a standard API. In this session, I am going to talk about how to employ dynamic proxy class generation to obtain view model out of domain model classes, and discuss view model API in detail."

    long:
      - "As distributed systems are becoming the norm, more demand rises for tools and methods for reliably building such systems. However, there is no silver bullet and just adopting a tool, technology or model does not make it easy to build reliable distributed systems. The actor based model existed since the 70s, but its popularity rose just in the last decade thanks to Erlang and Akka. As the actor model is adopted by more developers so are the misconceptions related to it. These misconceptions arise from marketing material and a general lack of understanding of distributed systems theory."

The approach presented uses some properties of the actor model and builds on TDD, property based testing and model checking in order to allow effective testing of distributed systems."

They carefully plan their activities and help the whole team to build better and usable products, by being a part of the project team from the beginning, before the first line of code is even written. Testers write code, read code, dig into databases and logs and communicate to customers. They are the link between the code and customers."
    long:
      - "If you are wondering what do testers in my teams do, I'll try to explain it in the short presentation. We code - automated functional test, help developers define and decide which test should be included in the integration test. We also read code - doing white box testing, seeing did our colleagues missed something or added something extra. We also try to manage risk, point out risky parts of applications and ways to mitigate those. Testers care about performance by helping developers build the software in the way that it is optimized and fast, we don't just measure the response times. The same goes for security. Also, we are helping developers to get wider picture of the impact of their code on the whole system. In couple of word - we help a lot. Either by investigating the quality of the code delivered, or by clarifying the requirements, and sometimes creating specification, if the team is missing it. What you will learn from this presentation: 1. Why do you need testing? 2. What can a good tester do for you and your team? 3. How proper testing can be organized 4. What to expect from your testers ( when you hire them) 5. What to look in a tester during hiring process."

    short:
      - "Microservices are the preferred architectural choice for scalable systems, in the recent years. With distributed nature of microservices and REST API being the most prevalent inter-service interface, we are faced with some challenges in choosing the right approach to authentication and authorization mechanisms. We will look into most popular SSO mechanisms, like SAML2, OAuth2 and JWT. We will look into pros and cons of these choices."
    long:
      - "Microservices are one possible architectural choice when building scalable systems. With microservices we build many small components, focused on business use-cases, with clear interfaces between services. Components are designed to work in orchestration, each one being a part of the team, with most commonly used interface being REST API. With this in mind, we are faced with a challenge of implementing a security system that can follow this chosen architecture, without becoming a bottleneck. Also, the choice of REST API, as a specialization of HTTP protocol narrows down possible solutions to the problem."
      - "In this talk we will first cover some theoretical aspects of security architectures. With security systems mostly focused on Identification, Authentication and Authorization, we will look into different implementations of security systems regarding these aspects."
      - "Authentication systems will be roughly divided into three categories:"
      - " "
      - "*Local (local user store)"
      - "*Distributed (NAS, LDAP, SQL-based)"
      - "*Delegated (Kerberos, OAuth2, SAML2)"
      - "Authorization is a process of deciding whether some action upon some target, by some entity, should be allowed. Authorization systems can roughly be divided into two groups:"
      - " "
      - "*Target based (UNIX DAC, ACL,...)"
      - "*Subject based (RBAC, entitlements)"
      - "With this in mind and having microservices as platform to apply security to, we are faced with a challenge of choosing the right architecture, so that we harnes and not hinder the power of our chosen platform. We will argue that the best choice for the microservices architecture is delegated or token-based authentication. Given the most prevalent inter-service interface is REST API, we will look into OAuth2, SAML2 and OAuth2/JWT as authentication-authorization mechanism. With that in mind, we will show differences in authorization when using these three mechanisms. We will show some examples of using OAuth2 + JWT as token-based mechanism and see pros and cons of each approach. SAML2 being similar in some aspects to JWT will be briefly mentioned."

But containers still have a key problem: monitoring and troubleshooting them is impractical, painful, and sometimes plain impossible. Even basic things like understanding what is using CPU, memory, or disk bandwidth inside a container are difficult - let alone finding out who a container is talking to on the network or tracking malicious activity. This presentation covers the current state of the art for container monitoring and visibility, including real use-cases and pros / cons of each."
      - "The focus is on advanced container visibility techniques, such as:"
      - "* visualizing a container’s network activity"
      - "* understanding detailed resource usage (CPU, memory and disk I/O) of containers and individual processes running inside containers"
      - "* following process and user activity inside containers"

No wonder since it's the closest thing to holograms we've been dreaming of and drooling over in works of fiction for the past five decades or so. While VR brings 'total' immersion and a set of problems caused by it, AR promises future full of holograms all around us, our physical and virtual worlds finally collided and merged. It’s hard to even imagine, let alone predict all the ways it will affect content creation, user experience and overall interaction with the world around us. Advancements in processing power of mobile platforms and image sensors fueled this recent surge of interest towards AR, but there is still a long road ahead of us from having contact lens-like, inconspicuous AR devices capable of rendering augmentation indistinguishable from the reality."

As we are focused more, what we like to do, we like quality food, so we decided to do something, as a startup for agriculture. We thought maybe we can help to provide some solutions for them. As we learned on the way, we cannot do it alone. We need your help."
      - "I will try to tease you, and point a direction, in return I expect though questions and knowledgeable debate."
    long:
      - IT has become a bridge for people from all over the world. You may be asking yourself, what is the importance of this when it comes to agriculture? Agriculture may be seen as a craft which has been handed down from generation to generation from the very first men who learned how to plow the fields and grow their own crops.
      - "Agricultural practices and advancements differ globally—since plants have their own differences and the location plays a role on their development as well. But through the exchange of knowledge from different agriculturally-involved individuals from all over the world, improvement of techniques can be experienced as well."
      - "Upon first glance, it may be challenging to see how such different sectors may work together. Agriculture has been around since men first learned to tend to his own crops and not depend on what just grows where he goes. IT, on the other hand, is a much younger advancement that man has developed. Hand in hand, IT and agriculture can make progress more visible, sharable, and measurable which are highly beneficial for all who are engaged in it."
      - "Since IT encompasses a lot of disciplines, it can also be successfully integrated to many different sectors to help them become more efficient and productive. It may take some getting used to, but when IT is successfully integrated to agriculture, it helps a great deal and can definitely contribute to positive changes that farmers can prove with the growth of their output.
      IT has made its way into the agricultural sector, and with positive results. To name a few, here are some of its effects:"
      - "•	Software Development – By having the necessary information, farmers—big and small can make better and more informed decision concerning their agricultural activities.
      In agriculture, time is everything. Than don’t be confused if I mention cloud, m-development and software development next to agriculture. (Big data, Analytics, Insurance….) These platforms will collect data from individual farms and process them in the cloud, allowing for the farm’s history, the known behavior of individual crops strains and the local weather forecast. They will then make recommendations to the farmer, perhaps pointing him towards some of the firm’s other products."
      - "•	Hardware Development –  Many SMART mechanization and development of modular principles and robotics in agriculture. (Precise Agriculture, automatization of greenhouses, solar energy, switching machinery on electrics) Did we mention drones? We are currently developing a drone with unique features and tractor which both runs on solar energy."
      - "•	Community involvement – Crowd Funding and direct sales, in last 3 years, there is 3500 new startups doing something for agriculture development community. (popup of e-commerce in Serbia is one way…) We have network of 63 cooperators which are growers and farmers, so we can test and share our knowledge in practice."
      - "•	Agricultural breakthroughs – Moving forward using all IT sectors for and with agriculture. We can name any industry and you can correlate with agriculture and there need to track or forecast. "
      - "•	Agriculture for everyone – Farmers have in-depth knowledge when it comes to their trade. However, interested individuals who may be called backyard farmers may also benefit from how modern technology has changed how agriculture is seen. Growing your own sustainable garden of herbs, fruit trees, and other agricultural produce can be possible in a smaller scale. Planting is beneficial in more ways than one, and having your own produce even helps assure the freshness and quality of the food your family eats."
      - "People only have to open their minds to the endless possibilities that technological advancement can bring to agriculture. "

    short:
      - "A year ago, a single application change would take days or weeks to deploy and involve many hand-offs and inevitable mistakes. Now, we’re doing about ten application deployments to production a day, and far more to the non-production environments. Come along and learn about our journey to becoming an effective DevOps organization, and the pitfalls we learned along the way."
    long:
      - "Every organization has their own definition of DevOps, and it is important that it is discovered naturally."
      - "Wherever you are, though, there's a wide range of tasks and activities that need to be addressed on a day to day basis that drive things like site reliability, release engineering, organizational efficiency, and much more. By instituting a DevOps culture, it's possible to simplify or entirely eliminate many of the Yak Shaving tasks that make safe change hard. There are many approaches to solving these problems but sadly, it's not as simple as saying 'DevOps' three times, or installing a particular piece of software, or sending all of your developers away to a class."
      - "At Gogo, we found that DevOps was a culture shift, and we embraced the paradigm where responsibility for successful change is placed directly in the hands of developers."
      - "During this session, Alex King will talk about Gogo's journey to this new world and will how our tooling, organization, and outlook have evolved over time. Join us to hear about the lessons we learned along the way."

It’s really easy to write an app in Spark, unfortunately it’s also easy to write one which doesn’t perform the way you would expect or just fails for no obvious reason. The talk will introduce a practical framework for fixing most common problems with Spark applications."

Are you already working with Spark but you are not happy, you don’t get expected performance and stability and you not sure where to look for a fix? Spark has very nice API and it promises high performance of crunching large datasets. It’s really easy to write an app in Spark, unfortunately it’s also easy to write one which doesn’t perform the way you would expect or just fails for no obvious reason. This talk will consist of multiple common problems one might face when running spark at scale and solutions for them of course. Each of described problems will come with well described background and examples so it will be understood by people with no Spark experience, although people who are working with spark are the main audience. At the end the audience should get a practical framework for optimizing Spark and fixing most common problems with Spark applications. Class of problems in the presentation: Dealing with skewed data Spark on yarn and it’s memory model Caching Sizing executors Locality "

    day: 1
    track: 2
    slot: 3
    short:
      - "Technological progress and invention is not sufficient to achieve innovation. Successful innovation requires 'system-building' skills i.e. ability to put together a coalition of investors, suppliers, customers, regulators etc."
    long:
      - "Invention is not the same as Innovation, just as a start-up or a small business are not by definition entrepreneurial activities. Indeed, entrepreneurial activities are not necessarily related to business. For a technological innovation to become more than a mere curiosity, it needs proper practical application i.e. it needs a well-defined market and/or demand, and it needs a set of organisational capabilities that would bring such technological innovation to the market."
      - "It is the System Builders who play the key role in converting new technology into an innovation. These players, not necessarily cutting-edge-technology-proficient but certainly technology-aware, are the true innovators, as they are capable of bringing together the whole value chain (suppliers of technology, suppliers of complementary technology, potential users, sellers, financiers, and so on). To illustrate with Afuah's definition, the process of innovation is 'the use of new technological and market knowledge to offer a new product or service.' If an innovation can at all be called 'disruptive', it is in the ability of the System Builders to challenge the status quo: this makes the process of innovation an inherently political exercise, for which a specific set of skills is required."
