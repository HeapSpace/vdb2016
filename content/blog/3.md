_Title_: **Efficient Cooking with Micro Services**

_In short_: How we used micro services and open API to cook our stuff better

_Long description_:

At one point, we needed a better way to handle multiple, arrrr, sources.
Using just phones and paper sheets was simply not working, while our, errr,
business expanded. We desperately needed to make the big move. So, we figured
we should have one central place to organize all our inputs (you know, a
place where the magic should be happening, and itâ€™s not a Bad). We decided
to use micro services architecture and API with mobile client.

Of course, we put a lot of effort to make the communication secure,
using available technologies; and yet to remain effective. On the other hand,
we had to provide simple interfaces that anyone from our...errr... business
associates could use without much trouble.

_We did it for us._
_We liked it._
_We were good at it._

All in all, we are the ones who kno...w! :)
