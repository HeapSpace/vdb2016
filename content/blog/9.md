First off, thank you all for participating!

We had two really great answers. We are thrilled when we see that people invested some time to crack the problem :) So, a huge thanks to [Boban Trajkovic](https://twitter.com/Trajkovic_Boban/status/747797619515195392) and [Cvetanka Trifunovska](http://polarcape.com/blog/mm-challenge-solution/). ðŸ’–

Letâ€™s try to unravel this challenge.

This is the number of m&ms in the full jar, both peanuts and chocolate ones **[197]**

The number of chocolate m&ms in the second jar is **[149]**
