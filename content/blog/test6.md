The important part of our mission is to support kids and young students on their way to the world of tech. This year, we invited an awesome group of high schoolers from Pećinci to join our volunteers team! Together with their professor Miloš Jeftić and principal Rakić mr. Spomenka, they will attend the conference and help you (wearing yellow shirts:). They are: Vladimir, Nikola, Dragana, Nikolina, Jovana, Radmila, Sladjana, Aleksa, Slavica and Anastasija!
