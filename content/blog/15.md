After summarizing all of the interesting data we got after VDB15, we started planning improvements to the program.

A lot of people perceives the Balkans as a troubled place on the geographical map of Europe, but this region has experienced a great rise in the IT industry with more than a couple of entrepreneurial pearls such as: [Strawberry energy](http://senergy.rs/?lang=en), [ActiveCollab](https://www.activecollab.com/), [Fishing Booker](https://fishingbooker.com/?gclid=CKDs5eOrmM4CFTEz0wod_OwMzQ) etc.  

However, what this region truly lacks is not either talent, or ideas, but a mindset that lets you mix these two.

        <div data-doughnut-value="75.40"></div>
        <div data-doughnut-value="24.60"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="legend"><i class="fa fa-circle blue"></i> Business (24.6%)</div>
      <div class="legend"><i class="fa fa-circle green"></i> Tech (75.4%)</div>
    </div>
  </div>

So this year we are introducing the **business track**. We think it’s important to talk about business topics as well, alongside with technology ones.

**24,6% of talks will be business oriented this year**.
