_We are coming to get you :)_

This is Dimitrije, a HeapSpace member and our associate Andrea who loves steampunk clothes! They will be visiting IT companies in Belgrade. 

We are delivering special gifts today to Clariness, Humanity, Deploy, Vast, Pamet, Bakson and TomTom. Voxxed Days is coming to their offices! 

The box is packed with goods announcing the Conference in September. 

[\#JustGotVoxxed]() someone will be, soon. 

Stay tuned for pics! :)
