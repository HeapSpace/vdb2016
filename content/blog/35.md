Yes, we know we blew your mind with our steampunk accessories at VDB this year, and let us be honest - it was our intention! :) 

Since many of you were very interested in getting steampunk glasses for your private collection, we’ll reveal our secret. The mysterious lady behind this creation is called [Miss Andrea Dolores](https://www.facebook.com/miss.andrea.dolores/?fref=ts).

She’s in love with steampunk, which is not hard to notice if you take a closer look of her work. Check out her Facebook Page [Steamladdie's Retrofuturistic Accessories](https://www.facebook.com/Steamladdies/?fref=ts) and choose your new accessories for autumn/winter 2016/17. :)
