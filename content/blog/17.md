HeapSpace community had a lot of different phases during its development. Our first decade of existence, was marked by only speaking one language, Java. And in 2012. we got tired of it.

Instead, we started dreamed of a different type of organization which is still coming to existence. We want to nurture the ability of this region to flourish despite all of its flaws. We want young people to understand that if they can’t find a job in a factory, or at the grocery store, that they can learn to code, design, or write and earn money via Internet. We don’t want them to flee the country, no.

We want them to help it grow and change.
