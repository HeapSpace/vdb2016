_We are coming to get you :)_

<br />

HeapSpace member Dimitrije and our associate Andrea who loves steampunk clothes will be visiting IT companies in Belgrade.

We are delivering special gifts today to Clariness, Humanity, Deploy, Vast, Pamet, Bakson and TomTom. Voxxed Days is coming to their offices!

The box is packed with goods announcing the Conference in September.
