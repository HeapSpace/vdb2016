Hopefully, there will be some energy left for the third day. Remember the scent of Belgrade and visit us again next year!

**_Top notes – public transportation_**

There is no better way to feel the true spirit of the city then by hopping on the [public transportation](http://www.gsp.rs/naslovna.aspx). Take the circular tram no 2 for a ride around the city center. There is a stop at the end of Knez Mihailova at Kalemegdan, or another one in the port or below Brankov bridge. Trolley number 41 is another great line which goes from Studentski trg,  straight to Dedinje - one of the poshest Belgradian suburbs. If you are more interested in visiting New Belgrade, the part of the city with the alien-like brutalist architecture, hop on the bus line no. 65 (bus station: Politika or Zeleni Venac) and enjoy the ride. 

**_Middle notes – nature_**

If you want to get away from the crowded city then take a relaxing walk through the [Zvezdara forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezdara) located in the east part of the urban city area, around 6 kilometres from Square of Republic. The forest is cut-through, in whole length, by the Volgina Street. Belgrade Observatory, one of the oldest scientific institutions in Serbia is located here. You can reach Zvezdara forest by bus line 65 or by trolley lines 28 and 40.

Košutnjak is another great forest-park area, located 6 km southwest from the downtown Belgrade. The evergreen and deciduous forest was once a hunting ground for Serbian royal family. Here you can enjoy a relaxing walk, have some barbecue, or even play tennis. Reach this amazing green oasis by buses (no. 53 or 23).

If you are an animal lover you should check The Belgrade Good Hope garden. The zoo is situated in the very centre of the city, within the Kalemegdan fortress. Belgrade Zoo is the home of different kinds of species including lions, seals, crocodiles, elephants, snakes, peacocks, and many more. It's definitely worth visiting!

**_Base notes - culture_**

And, last but not the least is the House of Flowers (“Kuća cveća”). This is a mausoleum, a resting place of former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito and his wife Jovanka Budisavljević Broz, and a part of the [Museum of Yugoslav History](http://www.mij.rs/) complex. If you want to get familiar with one of the iconic political leader get on the trolley no. 41 and be sure to stop at this magnificent place.

A true geek and a science admirer can’t miss the [Nikola Tesla museum](http://nikolateslamuseum.org/web/). Located in Krunska street, the museum has one of the biggest collection Tesla’s personal belongings including hats, glasses, cane, his clothes, notebooks, letters. You can take part in some amazing experiments as well!  The Museum is open every day except Monday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m, and the tours are organized every full hour.
