**How do these solutions work together to deliver the highest value to the customers?**


Sixsentix and QACube work together like an eco-system. Sixsentix offers a superior software testing methodology with priority-based testing for the fewest number of test cases with the highest risk/test coverage.  QACube reports on the progress and status of everything in one place; thereby, increasing the quality of the testing throughout the delivery process. All of this gives clients a better overview of their projects on a daily basis and with lower costs. 

**Why is this approach different in the market?**

There are hundreds of software testing and ALM tools in the market today. Companies with a large number of software projects, use different tools for testing, task management, defect tracking, development, etc. 

Their biggest challenge is to collect all of the data from these tools in one place to see big picture of the project. Another problem is collecting project statuses updates across projects in one place. Traditionally, companies used “home grown” approaches such as excel spreadsheets or pdfs for QA reporting. QACube aggregates and consolidates all of the information in one place.

When it comes to Sixsentix for Managed Testing Services, there is a unique methodology approach, with an emphasis on risk-based testing and test automatization. Sixsentix offers onsite, offline and nearshore testing. Sixsentix nearshore testing is becoming more popular among large enterprises because our clients can get an excellent quality service for a much lower price.  We help our customers keep pace with digitalization.

**What makes Sixsentix & QACube a great place to work in Serbia?**

I think it’s best to ask our employees, but I will try to answer... Both Sixsentix and QACube are companies with steady growth, working with global clients, mostly from banking, financial services and insurance sector, on very dynamic and interesting projects. Our success is due to the following:

<ul>
	<li>we have a large number of partners who have recognized our potential</li>

 	<li> continuous training for our employees,</li>

</ul>
 

We constantly invest in our office environment, equipment and teambuilding activities, because it is important to us that our employees are comfortable.  We “work hard” and “play hard”.  

**Which kind of talent will you be looking to add in the future?**
