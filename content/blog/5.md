Last year we launched the [M&M Challenge](https://voxxeddays.com/belgrade15/2015/05/24/mm-challenge/).
We even had a guy [draw a 3D model](https://twitter.com/svlada/status/602889450167902209) of the bowl and calculate the average female hand size. We were fascinated! Most of you said that there were 256 m&m's in the jar, and you were wrong. What a silly number, right?

Since you loved it last year and some of you got free tickets for Voxxed Days 2015, we are doing another M&M challenge this year :)

**Only now it's a bit tricky.**

This year you are much, much smarter. And this year, a person filming the video clips had an iPhone with slo-mo and time lapse and decided to use it all :)

Let's cut to the chase.

Here's the picture of two nice lemonade jars.

We want you to calculate the difference in the number of M&M's between these two jars.

In pursuit for delta.

In the full one, there are peanut and chocolate M&M's. Peanut M&M's are all different sizes.

In the small jar, there are only chocolate M&M's -- all of the same size and shape.

And, to make it a bit 'easier' for you, here's the video.

Good luck in winning FREE tickets for Voxxed Days 2016 and getting some cool steampunk props to go along! :)
