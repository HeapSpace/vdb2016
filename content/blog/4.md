There is the [Last Starfighter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087597/).
There is the [last supper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper). And we have
[the last call for call for papers](http://bit.ly/vdb16-cfpcall)!
(yeah, it’s a bit of recursion, we know :)

We are the VoxxedBelgrade 2016 conference. They call us
“_the most inspiring_”, “_mini-Devoxx_” and “_wow, last year was so great_”.
But don’t listen to them - just come and judge for yourself!

We would really loooove to gather some great speakers, including you.
Our mission is not only devoted to new technologies, but also to spread
the vision to the people, the real value behind what we are doing, and
your talk could make significant mindshift.

Imagine now that you are in the train, approaching quickly to
Voxxed Belgrade station. Many shiny and happy ppl from the train are already
ready (another recursion!) to get off on the next station, excitement is in
the air, you can even hear music. And you have to decide: **blue pill** or **green pill**?
Or maybe **yellow pill** or **red pill**? Or maybe **unicorn pill** or **monocrhome pill**?
Anyhow; go to Voxxed Belgrade and have mixture of excitement, good food, friendly people OR just pass all that by?

Your choice :)

We are calling for Your papers.


### EDIT: Does Blue/Red pill offends you?

Hey guys! We were brought to attention that "Blue/Red Pill" thing may be offensive
for some reasons we are _not_ aware of. So here is our official statement on this:

1. Read our [Code of Conduct](https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/code-of-conduct/).

2. Seriously, read our [Code of Conduct](https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/code-of-conduct/).
   It's there for a reason. It's not just letters on the paper... or web site.

3. In case you didn't recognize from the image above, "Blue/Red Pill" thing is
   reference to [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) movie.
   Yeah, only one of the top 20 movies on IMDB :) And't its all about
   making the **choice**.

4. Do you really get impression from the text that we want to offend someone/anyone?
   We have news for you: NO, it is not the idea.

5. Still not convinced? Just use any other color combination:
