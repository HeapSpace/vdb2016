          - "There's a lot of pieces needed to build a scalable IoT solution. Today most of these components exists as open source projects, which makes it easier than ever to connect large number devices to the cloud. This session will describe architecture and components of the scalable IoT solutions and open source projects that can be used to build them."
        long:
          - "The session will start by covering the general architecture of end-to-end IoT systems and describe in more details the role of every component. Next, it will dig deeper into all the components and explain open source projects that implement them. For example, we will see what are field gateways and how Eclipse Kura project implements those functionalities. IoT server connector's role will be described next and we'll see how Eclipse Hono helps connecting devices to the cloud. Finally, we'll examine an architecture of the IoT Cloud and see what it takes to handle and manage large number of devices. We'll also see how IoT cloud will be implemented in the upcoming open source project (which should be public by the time of the session). After this session, you'll have the big picture of how to connect devices to the cloud in scalable way and what open source projects to use to achieve that."

        short:
          - "After 10 years of hard work experience in Java Enterprise applications, I started several years ago teaching various topics that I mastered (www.victorrentea.ro). Among all these topics, by far the most important topic, that I always include in all my training sessions is 'Clean Code'. It's essential to be able to keep 'alive' 100k-2M lines of code. And I was told that this module has the biggest impact in day-to-day life of the dev."
          - "Also, this talk will also show how a professional developer should behave in code, the 'ethics code' that ough to be followed by everyone. We will go from the most basic concerns like how should we choose our names, how should we write our functions, format and (not) comment them, to more advanced topics of true Objects. The entire presentation is spiced with numerous esay to understand examples and code snippets."
          - "The contents of the material mainly revolves around the Clean Code boogvof Uncle Bob plus many other sourcesm"
        long:
          - "The primary value of software is to be flexible. The secondary value of software is to do what business wants it to do."
          - "Sounds insane? Just think a bit: what's the difference between IT and regular engineering? What propulsated IT that much? The ability to evolve, to adapt to new business needs. And we all know how difficult it is to adapt and strech old, dirty, rigid code."
          - "Financially, the fact that 80% of the costs of a software project are in maintenance may not concern you, the developer, directly. But the fact that you read 10x times more time than you write code should make it clear to you: do your very best to write clean, beautiful code that is easy to maintain. This module explains how do such art."
          - "Besides the bare act of writing code, the module also tackles the problematic of team work, code responsibility and cooperation necessary to any professional software engineer."
          - "The module covers the most important practical aspects from the reference book 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin, along with many other sources. The training material was reviewed and discussed with numerous seniors to reach a wider consensus regarding the ideas and their nuances."
          - "This is the module which is most likely to have the deepest impact on your day-to-day work, changing the way you exercise your profession. That's why I allways recommend to add this module to any training."

        title: 'Microservices Without Servers'
        type: 'talk'
        short:
          - "Developers spend too much time maintaining servers, rather than writing software. Recently, new cloud solutions, known as 'serverless' platforms, allow developers to write microservices without servers. What does a 'serverless' application look like, how do you create one and what are the challenges?"
          - "In this session, we'll introduce the 'serverless' stack, showing developers how to write microservices using these platforms. We'll look at migrating existing applications over to this new stack, common issues and challenges that you need to consider and tools to support serverless development."
        long:
          - "Servers are killing your productivity."
          - "Rather than building better software for your users, you end up constantly distracted by maintaining computers."
          - "Wasn't the 'cloud' supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we realised it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter. We couldn't escape 'servers'."
          - "Until now..."
          - "With the launch of services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and OpenWhisk, you can now run code on the cloud without servers!"
          - "These platforms let you build stateless microservices, combining APIs with business logic, without servers. Microservices are executed on-demand, in milliseconds, rather than having to sit idle waiting for incoming requests. Users pay only for the raw computation time used."
          - "...but how?"
          - "In this session, developers will learn how to write “microservices” for a popular serverless platform, understanding the capabilities and constraints for the platform. We’ll look at common challenges, such as handling static file hosting, exposing services as public APIs and managing application dependencies, before explaining the solutions. Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms."
          - "This session is aimed at software developers experienced in building traditional backend web applications, who want to learn how to build microservices without servers."
          - "If you’re spending too much time managing computers, rather than writing software, come to this session to learn how to banish your servers from application development forever!"

        long:
          - "We can think of the whole computer systems like a human body that consist of cells of various types. They can be hardware or software. When they are software units, the smaller they are, the easier it is for them to self-heal, recuperate from failures, multiply or even get destroyed when that is needed. We call those small units microservices, and they can indeed have behaviours similar to those observed in a human body.  Microservices-based systems can be made in a way that they have the ability to self-heal. That is not to say that self-healing we are about to explore is applicable only to microservices. It is not. However, self-healing can be applied to almost any type of the architecture but provides best results when combined with microservices."

From there on we'll move from requirements, technological choices and development environment setup, through coding and testing all the way until the final deployment to production. We won't stop there. Once our new services are up and running we'll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, recuperate them in case of failures and create central monitoring and notifications system. We'll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible."
        long:
          - "Microservices are becoming more and more popular and, as with every other new trend, often implemented without enough experience. Idea behind them is easy to explain. Brake monolithic application into smaller independent services. That's it. That is what many think microservices are about. However, implementation is much harder to master. There are many things to consider when embarking down this path. How do we organize microservices? Which technologies to use and how? Should they be mutable or not? How to test them? How to deploy them? How to create scalable and fault tolerant systems? Self-healing, zero-downtime and logging? How should the teams be organized? Today's successful implementations of microservices require all those and many other questions to be answered. It's not only about splitting things into smaller pieces. The whole development ecosystem needs to be changed and we need to take a hard look at the microservices development lifecycle."

We'll see how microservices fit into continuous deployment and immutable containers concepts and why the best results are obtained when those three are combined into one unique framework."
          - "During the workshop we'll explore tools like Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Ansible, Consul, etcd, confd, Registrator, nginx, HAProxy, ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana, and so on."

        title: 'Narrative Language of Virtual Reality'
        type: 'talk'
        short:
          - "VR is not just a 'cutting edge technology' but also a medium capable to immerse the viewer/player in another dimension and convey strong emotions. How to do so in the right way? Which techniques and tools content creators can use to convey such feelings? If the cinematic medium has a 'language', what's about VR? How to create contents with awareness?"
        long:
          - "Since Virtual Reality is still a developing concept, we are at that stage I would call the 'democratization of the discovery.' Everyone could have access to this technology and all could potentially contribute to its accomplishment. I, therefore, felt an urge to be involved with this project, trying to explore some of the aspects of this new and exciting technological breakthrough. However, the entertainment aspect of Virtual Reality, especially the way it allows storytelling is what attracts me the most to this product. That said if you tell a story as though you would in the film, you would soon meet problems, which would raise doubts and queries. It seems that applying the general audio-visual ‘rules’ achieved whilst watching a film or any other audio-visual content is not possible. One must take into consideration new factors which require ample research focused on studying and synthesizing a new language, a language that is specific and adequate to VR technology."
          - "This paper, therefore, aims to explore as deeply as possible, with the entail means and limitations, what are the ‘semantic factors’, the ‘vocabulary’, the ‘techniques’ that can elevate VR from just an advanced technological product to a real communication means. To do this, it was necessary to keep in mind the language closest to that of VR, the cinematic one. Thanks to the use of specific texts, alongside the knowledge in the appearance of audio-visual content acquired both through my academic career and through literature, it was possible to decipher the language used in VR, often comparing it to the one used in film. It was necessary to determine which 'words' you could translate into Virtual Reality directly, the ones which needed adjustments and finally the words which ultimately could not be translated at all. "
          - "In parallel to this translation, it was also crucial to pay close attention to all the features that made Virtual Reality a means of communication in its own right, those factors that characterized VR and gave it an identity of its own. It was further important to ‘test’ a large number of experiences currently available to understand what these various creators of VR experiences did to convey certain emotions and meanings to their audience. In the same way, it’s been extremely useful to listen and see what these c reators expressed during the main events focused on VR like the ‘Oculus Connect’ and ‘SVVR Expo’, thanks to video sharing platforms like YouTube. Support from the study Bully! Entertainment was essential. It allowed me to use all their equipment at the forefront of Virtual Reality and at the same time gave me the opportunity to ￼5 “Narrative Language of Virtual Reality” Aimone Bodini analyze qualitatively VR experiences through the exchange of opinions and thoughts with professionals within the studio. "
          - "This research is divided into two main parts. Initially, the reader is given an introduction to the historical context of VR, briefly explaining the advancements in this technology to date as well as introducing the key figures within this field. The first part analyzes the literature available, explaining the methodology of this research and the tools that will be used to define VR language. The second part starts with a brief explanation of the human eye, how stereoscopy works, defining what is the field of view and how these features are fundamental for VR. Subsequently, the focus will shift towards the main feature of VR, or the so-called sense of 'presence' explaining the meaning and requirements necessary to create it. "
          - "The relationship with characters in Virtual Reality must also be understood and is discussed throughout as it changes the relationship that they establish with the audience is different to that through mediums such as literature or cinema. Exploring how editing works in this field is also detrimental to understanding what can be translated from the cinematic field and where new ways must be devised in terms of “Cutting” that VR allows. The technology specific to VR is also described, in terms of both the 3 and 6 degrees of freedom, as well as explaining how it can be used creatively for narrative purposes from editing to interacting with the environment and characters. The exploration of this newly discovered language that the world hides behind single details and this topic of research requires much broader and deeper research that what was initially thought. What has been explored here is a first step in decoding the narrative language in Virtual Reality, which just scraped the tip of the iceberg. This is an important step in encouraging other researchers and scholars to demystify this area. Overall, this research is proof that VR has a language of its own and demonstrates that the knowledge of this language is fundamental to convey the correct emotions and to fully immerse the user in Virtual Reality.

And not only that, but also how we interact with the world. The computer brings us into a unique position to have an impact that lasts longer than only the next iteration of a new technology. What happens when we see ourselves not only as developers and designers, but reconsider the interaction between people and computers in general?"
        long:
          - "We are 50 years into the computer revolution, at what feels like our moment of greatest progress. There is technology easily worth one million dollars in a smartphone. The phone, calculators, cameras, games, music and video players. All of which at the date of release have cost more than a phone itself, when it first entered the market. Today's ubiquitous graphical user interface has its roots in concepts dating back to the mid-'60s. These concepts were then further developed at XEROX Parc in the '70s, and successfully commercialized in the Apple Macintosh in the early '80s, whereupon they essentially froze. "
          - "Now, despite thousand-fold improvements along every technological dimension, the concepts behind today's interfaces are almost identical to those in the initial Mac. This talk will focus on these ideas and try to convey the computer as a new medium, similar as the printing press, the radio, the TV and the car are and were. "
          - "To make progress as humanity we have to focus on media and tools will have an impact that lasts longer than the next iteration of a new technology. Marshall McLuhan once famously said 'we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us'. We have to start shaping our tools - the computer - and tackle problems such as collaboration, invent better principles than pencil and paper thinking and have to come up with better paradigms. Otherwise, we will not shape our tools - they will shape us. "

        long:
          - "Messengers now have an incredible reach and in 2015 messaging apps have overtaken social networks to become the dominant platforms on mobile phones. Chatbots will be one of the next big evolutions of mobile messengers and they are changing the way how users interact with a service. People are downloading fewer apps, and bots within messengers are quickly becoming a new way to enrich these platforms with context from outside. Messengers like WeChat already showed how to build a truly mobile platform with a pioneering model of 'apps within an app'. Adding a chatbot has a way lower barrier for users, since there’s no need to go to an appstore and download an app, it can just be added as a contact. This is super effective for lower-frequency but important services like managing credit card statements, utility bills or recurring shop orders. For these use cases, chatbots are a perfect fit since adding the bot is extremely lightweight instead of downloading a separate native full-featured apps."
          - "Chatbots unify the UI and the interaction with a service even more than mobile apps do. They have the potential to be easier to use and learnings to be transferred from one to the other. Users do not have to learn the UI from scratch because they are already familiar with the core UI and interaction concepts from chatting with other people."
          - "This talk is an overview on existing messenger and messenger bot platforms, how they differentiate from each other, not only in terms of technical specifications but also in terms of which different UI elements they are providing to enrich the communication within a messenger. Furthermore I will provide best practices and personal experiences for developing and building chatbots from a technical point of view as well as for designing a great user experience within a messaging app."

Mastered the red-green-refactor workflow and want to know what is the next step? Our Lisp grandfathers knew how invaluable was the immediate feedback that a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) allowed during development and now Java 9 will have one. Perhaps you have read that a REPL is useful for 'playing around' or for 'small code snippets', but this is far from true. In this presentation, you will learn how with a REPL you can have a better and more productive developer workflow by building a Tomcat service, one bit at a time, without having to build, compile, package or deploy it. Demo will be done with a Clojure REPL but no previous experience with Clojure is needed."
        long:
          - "The motivation of the presentation is to show that in the JVM we do not need to suffer from the long code/build/deploy cycle when developing. Using TDD somehow ease the pain as the number of times that you need to recompile/repackage/redeploy as often, but there are still lots of code/configuration that cannot be tested unless you start the whole application. Also to be able to do TDD, you first need to understand how APIs (libraries/restful services) will behave and what kind of data they will return. The presentation will demo how with a REPL you can help with: * Build a full application a bit at a time, without having to recompile, repackage or redeploy it. * Understand libraries. * Explore existing databases and http services. * Improve the TDD workflow. * Inspect the state of a running application. * Debug in staging or even production environments. The presentation will be mostly a live coding demo with few slides. Coding will be done in Clojure, but the presentation will focus on the workflow that a REPL allows. "

Servers are on fire, exceptions are flooding the logs, and your customers are taking their frustration to Twitter. What do you do?"
          - "Every company that succeeds (and that's what we're all aiming for, right?) will have to solve this problem eventually. We'll talk about how Yammer evolved from having just a single person as 'the' on-call engineer, to a cross-geo follow-the-sun on-call team that satisfies customer needs, meets Microsoft standards, and doesn't kill engineers. You'll leave this talk with tips on what worked and what didn’t, to help you build this process for your team."
