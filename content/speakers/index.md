However, the overall mobile market still has to be considered as young and especially unstandardized. This really puts a lot of organizations in front of huge challenges concerning the efficient development of mobile applications and the secure integration into backend IT systems. - But there is no way around mobile in the next years! The smart combination of mobile techniques (mBaaS, microservices, etc.) and business process management approaches will definitely drive process efficiency and speed to a whole new level."
#           - "In this presentation I will outline the floating icebergs you should look at when implementing mobile and BPM in your enterprise. In addition to that you will learn how other companies have successfully implemented mobile to optimize their processes."

This session will describe architecture and components of the scalable IoT solutions and open source projects that can be used to build them."
#         long:
#           - "The session will start by covering the general architecture of end-to-end IoT systems and describe in more details the role of every component. Next, it will dig deeper into all the components and explain open source projects that implement them. For example, we will see what are field gateways and how Eclipse Kura project implements those functionalities. IoT server connector's role will be described next and we'll see how Eclipse Hono helps connecting devices to the cloud. Finally, we'll examine an architecture of the IoT Cloud and see what it takes to handle and manage large number of devices. We'll also see how IoT cloud will be implemented in the upcoming open source project (which should be public by the time of the session). After this session, you'll have the big picture of how to connect devices to the cloud in scalable way and what open source projects to use to achieve that."

#           - "After 10 years of hard work experience in Java Enterprise applications, I started several years ago teaching various topics that I mastered (www.victorrentea.ro). Among all these topics, by far the most important topic, that I always include in all my training sessions is 'Clean Code'. It's essential to be able to keep 'alive' 100k-2M lines of code. And I was told that this module has the biggest impact in day-to-day life of the dev."
#           - "Also, this talk will also show how a professional developer should behave in code, the 'ethics code' that ough to be followed by everyone. We will go from the most basic concerns like how should we choose our names, how should we write our functions, format and (not) comment them, to more advanced topics of true Objects. The entire presentation is spiced with numerous esay to understand examples and code snippets."

#           - "Sounds insane? Just think a bit: what's the difference between IT and regular engineering? What propulsated IT that much? The ability to evolve, to adapt to new business needs. And we all know how difficult it is to adapt and strech old, dirty, rigid code."
#           - "Financially, the fact that 80% of the costs of a software project are in maintenance may not concern you, the developer, directly. But the fact that you read 10x times more time than you write code should make it clear to you: do your very best to write clean, beautiful code that is easy to understand and maintain. This talk explains how write such art."
#           - "Besides the bare writing of code, the talk will touch on the problematic of team work, code responsibility and cooperation, necessary to any professional software engineer."
#           - "This talk reviews the most important practical guidelines from the reference book 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin, as they proved essential in so many situations of my experience."

#         title: 'Microservices Without Servers'
#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "Developers spend too much time maintaining servers, rather than writing software. Recently, new cloud solutions, known as 'serverless' platforms, allow developers to write microservices without servers. What does a 'serverless' application look like, how do you create one and what are the challenges?"
#           - "In this session, we'll introduce the 'serverless' stack, showing developers how to write microservices using these platforms. We'll look at migrating existing applications over to this new stack, common issues and challenges that you need to consider and tools to support serverless development."
#         long:
#           - "Servers are killing your productivity."
#           - "Rather than building better software for your users, you end up constantly distracted by maintaining computers."
#           - "Wasn't the 'cloud' supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we realised it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter. We couldn't escape 'servers'."
#           - "Until now..."
#           - "With the launch of services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and OpenWhisk, you can now run code on the cloud without servers!"
#           - "These platforms let you build stateless microservices, combining APIs with business logic, without servers. Microservices are executed on-demand, in milliseconds, rather than having to sit idle waiting for incoming requests. Users pay only for the raw computation time used."
#           - "...but how?"
#           - "In this session, developers will learn how to write “microservices” for a popular serverless platform, understanding the capabilities and constraints for the platform. We’ll look at common challenges, such as handling static file hosting, exposing services as public APIs and managing application dependencies, before explaining the solutions. Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms."
#           - "This session is aimed at software developers experienced in building traditional backend web applications, who want to learn how to build microservices without servers."
#           - "If you’re spending too much time managing computers, rather than writing software, come to this session to learn how to banish your servers from application development forever!"

#           - "We can think of the whole computer systems like a human body that consist of cells of various types. They can be hardware or software. When they are software units, the smaller they are, the easier it is for them to self-heal, recuperate from failures, multiply or even get destroyed when that is needed. We call those small units microservices, and they can indeed have behaviours similar to those observed in a human body.  Microservices-based systems can be made in a way that they have the ability to self-heal. That is not to say that self-healing we are about to explore is applicable only to microservices. It is not. However, self-healing can be applied to almost any type of the architecture but provides best results when combined with microservices."

We won't stop there. Once our new services are up and running we'll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, recuperate them in case of failures and create central monitoring and notifications system. We'll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible."
#         long:
#           - "Microservices are becoming more and more popular and, as with every other new trend, often implemented without enough experience. Idea behind them is easy to explain. Brake monolithic application into smaller independent services. That's it. That is what many think microservices are about. However, implementation is much harder to master. There are many things to consider when embarking down this path. How do we organize microservices? Which technologies to use and how? Should they be mutable or not? How to test them? How to deploy them? How to create scalable and fault tolerant systems? Self-healing, zero-downtime and logging? How should the teams be organized? Today's successful implementations of microservices require all those and many other questions to be answered. It's not only about splitting things into smaller pieces. The whole development ecosystem needs to be changed and we need to take a hard look at the microservices development lifecycle."

There is something not being addressed though, like if it is some kind of dirty little secret, and that is frontend development. The common practice for building websites remains 'the monolith': a single frontend codebase that consumes multiple APIs. We believe we found a better solution."

#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "VR is not just a 'cutting edge technology' but also a medium capable to immerse the viewer/player in another dimension and convey strong emotions. How to do so in the right way? Which techniques and tools content creators can use to convey such feelings? If the cinematic medium has a 'language', what's about VR? How to create contents with awareness?"
#         long:
#           - "Since Virtual Reality is still a developing concept, we are at that stage I would call the 'democratization of the discovery.' Everyone could have access to this technology and all could potentially contribute to its accomplishment. I, therefore, felt an urge to be involved with this project, trying to explore some of the aspects of this new and exciting technological breakthrough. However, the entertainment aspect of Virtual Reality, especially the way it allows storytelling is what attracts me the most to this product. That said if you tell a story as though you would in the film, you would soon meet problems, which would raise doubts and queries. It seems that applying the general audio-visual ‘rules’ achieved whilst watching a film or any other audio-visual content is not possible. One must take into consideration new factors which require ample research focused on studying and synthesizing a new language, a language that is specific and adequate to VR technology."
#           - "This paper, therefore, aims to explore as deeply as possible, with the entail means and limitations, what are the ‘semantic factors’, the ‘vocabulary’, the ‘techniques’ that can elevate VR from just an advanced technological product to a real communication means. To do this, it was necessary to keep in mind the language closest to that of VR, the cinematic one. Thanks to the use of specific texts, alongside the knowledge in the appearance of audio-visual content acquired both through my academic career and through literature, it was possible to decipher the language used in VR, often comparing it to the one used in film. It was necessary to determine which 'words' you could translate into Virtual Reality directly, the ones which needed adjustments and finally the words which ultimately could not be translated at all. "
#           - "In parallel to this translation, it was also crucial to pay close attention to all the features that made Virtual Reality a means of communication in its own right, those factors that characterized VR and gave it an identity of its own. It was further important to ‘test’ a large number of experiences currently available to understand what these various creators of VR experiences did to convey certain emotions and meanings to their audience. In the same way, it’s been extremely useful to listen and see what these c reators expressed during the main events focused on VR like the ‘Oculus Connect’ and ‘SVVR Expo’, thanks to video sharing platforms like YouTube. Support from the study Bully! Entertainment was essential. It allowed me to use all their equipment at the forefront of Virtual Reality and at the same time gave me the opportunity to “Narrative Language of Virtual Reality” Aimone Bodini analyze qualitatively VR experiences through the exchange of opinions and thoughts with professionals within the studio. "
#           - "This research is divided into two main parts. Initially, the reader is given an introduction to the historical context of VR, briefly explaining the advancements in this technology to date as well as introducing the key figures within this field. The first part analyzes the literature available, explaining the methodology of this research and the tools that will be used to define VR language. The second part starts with a brief explanation of the human eye, how stereoscopy works, defining what is the field of view and how these features are fundamental for VR. Subsequently, the focus will shift towards the main feature of VR, or the so-called sense of 'presence' explaining the meaning and requirements necessary to create it. "
#           - "The relationship with characters in Virtual Reality must also be understood and is discussed throughout as it changes the relationship that they establish with the audience is different to that through mediums such as literature or cinema. Exploring how editing works in this field is also detrimental to understanding what can be translated from the cinematic field and where new ways must be devised in terms of “Cutting” that VR allows. The technology specific to VR is also described, in terms of both the 3 and 6 degrees of freedom, as well as explaining how it can be used creatively for narrative purposes from editing to interacting with the environment and characters. The exploration of this newly discovered language that the world hides behind single details and this topic of research requires much broader and deeper research that what was initially thought. What has been explored here is a first step in decoding the narrative language in Virtual Reality, which just scraped the tip of the iceberg. This is an important step in encouraging other researchers and scholars to demystify this area. Overall, this research is proof that VR has a language of its own and demonstrates that the knowledge of this language is fundamental to convey the correct emotions and to fully immerse the user in Virtual Reality.

What happens when we see ourselves not only as developers and designers, but reconsider the interaction between people and computers in general?"

#           - "We are 50 years into the computer revolution, at what feels like our moment of greatest progress. There is technology easily worth one million dollars in a smartphone. The phone, calculators, cameras, games, music and video players. All of which at the date of release have cost more than a phone itself, when it first entered the market. Today's ubiquitous graphical user interface has its roots in concepts dating back to the mid-'60s. These concepts were then further developed at XEROX Parc in the '70s, and successfully commercialized in the Apple Macintosh in the early '80s, whereupon they essentially froze. "

This talk will focus on these ideas and try to convey the computer as a new medium, similar as the printing press, the radio, the TV and the car are and were. "

Marshall McLuhan once famously said 'we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us'. We have to start shaping our tools - the computer - and tackle problems such as collaboration, invent better principles than pencil and paper thinking and have to come up with better paradigms. Otherwise, we will not shape our tools - they will shape us. "

#           - "Messengers now have an incredible reach and in 2015 messaging apps have overtaken social networks to become the dominant platforms on mobile phones. Chatbots will be one of the next big evolutions of mobile messengers and they are changing the way how users interact with a service. People are downloading fewer apps, and bots within messengers are quickly becoming a new way to enrich these platforms with context from outside. Messengers like WeChat already showed how to build a truly mobile platform with a pioneering model of 'apps within an app'. Adding a chatbot has a way lower barrier for users, since there’s no need to go to an appstore and download an app, it can just be added as a contact. This is super effective for lower-frequency but important services like managing credit card statements, utility bills or recurring shop orders. For these use cases, chatbots are a perfect fit since adding the bot is extremely lightweight instead of downloading a separate native full-featured apps."
#           - "Chatbots unify the UI and the interaction with a service even more than mobile apps do. They have the potential to be easier to use and learnings to be transferred from one to the other. Users do not have to learn the UI from scratch because they are already familiar with the core UI and interaction concepts from chatting with other people."

Mastered the red-green-refactor workflow and want to know what is the next step? Our Lisp grandfathers knew how invaluable was the immediate feedback that a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) allowed during development and now Java 9 will have one. Perhaps you have read that a REPL is useful for 'playing around' or for 'small code snippets', but this is far from true. In this presentation, you will learn how with a REPL you can have a better and more productive developer workflow by building a Tomcat service, one bit at a time, without having to build, compile, package or deploy it. Demo will be done with a Clojure REPL but no previous experience with Clojure is needed."
#         long:
#           - "The motivation of the presentation is to show that in the JVM we do not need to suffer from the long code/build/deploy cycle when developing. Using TDD somehow ease the pain as the number of times that you need to recompile/repackage/redeploy as often, but there are still lots of code/configuration that cannot be tested unless you start the whole application. Also to be able to do TDD, you first need to understand how APIs (libraries/restful services) will behave and what kind of data they will return."

We'll talk about how Yammer evolved from having just a single person as 'the' on-call engineer, to a cross-geo follow-the-sun on-call team that satisfies customer needs, meets Microsoft standards, and doesn't kill engineers. You'll leave this talk with tips on what worked and what didn’t, to help you build this process for your team."

During this presentation we'll talk about our process, how we adopted lean thinking over Scrum or any other 'instant' process, and managed to shorten time to market 2x for big features in two latest iterations. Best part is that it keeps getting shorter with each iteration. A big feature used to take us 45 days to develop. Releasing a feature of equivalent complexity now takes about three weeks on average. This is from the start until the moment a finished product is available to the customer (only DoD that matters to us). It includes kick-off, development, testing, code review, documentation, staging, release and announcement. From our perspective, that’s a 100% increase in productivity. We accomplished it with the same resources and people - the only difference being constant retrospectives and improvement of the way we work."

To most developers the technology is tangential to the business they work in, and is often disregarded with much hand waving as “just a pipe” for message distribution. Without a clear understanding of their capabilities and underlying design decisions, we imagine myths about how these systems “should” work and are frustrated in production by behaviours emerging from their design trade-offs."

We need better tools. We need our machines to automatically verify the fundamental correctness of our systems. These tools have been around for a while, but until recently the 'Getting Started' material has been thin on the ground. In this talk I will show you how to get up and running and ready to build stuff with a Rails-like framework underpinned by one of the fastest and most stable languages in the industry: Haskell. The talk will cover everything from setting up a development environment, to integrating with a database and deploying to a VPS.

Todays standards require us to analyze data in real-time so that we can react accordingly and gain insights as the data is streamed into our system."
#         long:
#           - "Traditional data warehousing and data analytics was an offline job and it usually required a lot of time to complete and give some results. These operations gave us some insight into our business but we had a limited possibility to improve or react in a timely manner. One of the efforts to move this approach closer to real-time was described with Lambda architecture where raw data was stored in real-time while also being analyzed in parallel and producing results with a certain delay. This approach eliminated those long running jobs by preparing analytic results on the incoming data but in todays business right information at the right time can mean improving our business and directly leading to more profit. Our latest technologies give us possibility to execute analytics on data streams and react almost instantly. Faster data requires faster reactions especially if its a fraud detection or a mission critical system. NoETL philosophy explains why the traditional approach is no longer valid and why we need these new technologies that we have today. In this presentation we are going to talk about the evolution from monolithic to distributed systems, pros and cons of both approaches and what we are able to do with todays technologies. Our main focus is going to be fast data stack (Spark, Mesos, Akka, Cassandra, Kafka) and how using these technologies we can create scalable and fast data pipeline while running real-time data analytics."

You'll take a look at the evolution of architectures, beginning with a central event emitter or publish/subscribe system that's currently used in JavaScript libraries and frameworks. You'll contrast these with Reactive programming and channels communication that's offered by CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes). By the end of this session, you'll understand if and when to use each particular paradigm.

#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "Why do we build applications based on microservices? To gain flexibility and resilience - that’s what everybody tells us. But building and application with a lot of microservices leads to a highly distributed system - and distribution hurts!"
#         long:
#           - "As soon as you start interacting with a remote process you will have to bear in mind that messages might get lost, the network might go down and you will experience that communication will surely increase the latency your users are about to experience while using your system. So how can we break a large application into small microservices while keeping dependencies between those services at the lowest possible level and how can we reduce communication in the overall system? We will have a look at „Event-Sourcing“ as a possible and very cool answer for these questions. The basic idea is that every component emits relevant (from a business point of view) state changes as events. Those events are used a technique for asynchronous communication and data exchange/replication between microservices. The talk will also include some code samples to demonstrate how to introduce event sourcing in Java-based microservices."

#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "In large organisations, sometimes projects and parts of the code base get shuffled around between teams. Projects that have tons of responsibilities, that are business critical and that are hard to look after. What happens when a self-organised team that has a continuous delivery system in place receives one of these legacy product that is the antithesis of best practices? The talk approaches this issue with a real life example, highlighting the problems encountered and the solutions suggested and applied to each of them."
#         long:
#           - "The talk starts describing what a hot potato is: a project that breaks all the good practices a team has in place but it’s business critical and needs to be handled. After a general introduction, it gets down into more specific details of the project that need to be addressed: two months deployment cycle, extremely long start-up time, huge amount of responsibilities... And then breaks them down into smaller, more approachable problems. Once the problems have been reduced to something that can be handled, the talk approaches possible solutions."
#           - "It explains pros and cons of each of them an why one is chosen over the other: the two-months deployment cycle gets dramatically reduced by creating a bamboo plan owned by the team; the start-up time decrements in several steps that include blue-green deployment plus code refactoring; and many other issues get resolved piece by piece. Why are these solutions chosen over others? Sometimes for its quality, sometimes it's chosen due to certain constrains like time, resources, adaptability... Reasons for each of them are the centre of the talk. Finalising the talk, there is a comparison between how the project looked at the beginning and how it behaves after all the improvements."

#         long:

Often business benefits and social presence become secondary to innovation. But in the end you need customers, and happy customers. What are the steps you can make while developing to generate customers, evangelists and how to gather feedback without the final product? How to keep the sales going without any product? Why not wait until the final prototype? What have learned with early testing? Why and how should you define the business value? Why lean startup methods won’t work if you are running a HW startup? How business decisions like patenting or open sourcing can make or break your build up and content marketing? When should you put your prototype in the hands of your first users? How can you learn? What do founders miss while testing? A lots of dos and donts for HW and IoT startup founders."

#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "In the era of social networks and multimedia, TV that is sitting in our living room is becoming more and more like entertainment center, not just a device that we use to watch news, some sports event or our favorite series. Nowadays, people want to sit back in their couch, relax, and be able to do things that can be done on computers and smartphones, just on a large screen. From watching YouTube videos, sharing and posting on Facebook, or following latest trends on twitter, creators of Smart TV applications are struggling to make this possible and accessible by using only few remote controller buttons. Different solutions that enable user to interact with most popular internet services today, from Android and Apple TV, to standard Smart TVs are not available to everyone. Our wish was to bring this technology to every home that has domestic IPTV service. So, we rolled up our sleeves, took a leap into JavaScript world of different API’s, optimizations for TV box embedded operating systems, limitations of hardware, and interface specifics, and delivered a product that can match today’s most modern solutions in TV applications. This is our success story, one that tells how we took 80$ TV box, and put Facebook, twitter and YouTube inside it."
#         long:
#           - "This talk will cover all aspects of delivering social networks experiences to lightweight TV box sets, but it will be concentrated around usage of JavaScript API that Facebook, twitter and Google provide for developing third party applications. In introduction we will be talking about apps development for TV boxes in general: specifics of TV interface, limitations of hardware, summary of TV box operating systems and web browsers and technologies that can be used. In implementation we will do short summary of all APIs needed for development, concentrating on explanation of key parts of code like login and authorization, data fetching, presentation of content, and posting users actions and feedback. We will also give parallel comparison of Google, Facebook and twitter API’s, and a small live coding demo of most interesting functionalities like sharing information about currently watched TV channel on Facebook and twitter, or playback of YouTube videos. In challenges and limitations, we will talk of things that are hard to be done, or cannot be done, such as long process of Facebook authorization, workarounds that enable simple and user friendly login to twitter, or videos that are allowed to be played only on YouTube web site. Also, we will say something more about functionalities that these companies do not enable to third party apps such as viewing your friends profile on Facebook, or adding previously watched video to YouTube history. At the end, in experience, we will give you a live demo of how it works, using real Set Top Box device. We will turn it on, and see some of its great features like: + Device login – enables us to avoid entering username and password using remote controller + YouTube auto play – user can search for its favorite video once, and enjoy similar videos playing one by one, for hours + Twitter and Facebook one-button share – when you watch your favorite TV show, and want your friends to know about it, you just need to enter Facebook or twitter app, and press a button to share it + Adaptive video quality – depending of quality of your internet connection, YouTube automatically chooses best possible video quality up to HD, without you ever needing to set it manually "

#         short:
#           - "Nowadays almost everyone uses web browsers on a daily basis for various tasks such as reading emails, surfing on social networks or purchasing goods on ecommerce shops. Despite this, web developers often tend to forget that a browser is a piece of software that has deliberately been designed as a remote code execution engine, which is the dream spec for any attacker. The focus of this talk is to explain how some of the newly introduced headers (HSTS, HPKP, CSP) can help to easily add an extra layer of security in order to defend your web apps against common web security vulnerabilities."
#         long:
#           - "Security flaws on websites are very widespread and depending on the nature of the website can lead to severe consequences. One of the reason why securing web apps can be challenging is that many security aspects such as client side security, transport security and server side security have to be considered during design, implementation and operation. Another fundamental problem of the web is the web browser that has deliberately been designed as remote code execution engine which is the dream platform for any attacker wanting, for instance, to inject malicious code either by exploiting an Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability or by mounting a man-in-the-middle attack. Since a browser executes JavaScript and HTML on the fly with 'almost' no security checks it is important to be able to identify the origin of the content and to take advantage of the available means to restrict how the browser executes the web app. This is exactly what this talk is about! I will start with brief overview about what is wrong with the web and especially with web browsers. Then I will explain why secure transport is so important and point out the different guarantees that HTTPS provides, such as confidentiality, authenticity and integrity and why there is no valid reason for not using it over HTTP. I will show you how to get a free certificate for your website and how to test the HTTPS configuration. The main focus of this talk are the newly introduced headers, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) and Content Security Policy (CSP). I will explain how HSTS and HPKP help to harden HTTPS against various attacks but also present the best practices for avoiding the common pitfalls. I will continue by explaining CSP and its capabilities, such as preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Clickjacking attacks. I will also give best practices about deriving the CSP policies without having negative side effects on your website and present tools that will make your CSP journey as easy as pie. All the aforementioned headers offer security “for free” in the defence of your web apps so start using them today!"

#         title: 'Employing a View Model API Based on Dynamic Proxies'
#         type: 'talk'
#         short:
#           - "Enterprise apps are mainly built upon layered architecture. Each layer only speaks to its below layer, and data among layers are shared via persistent domain objects. However, employing same domain objects in each layer causes some problems. Data might be modified unintentionally in which an ORM tool or a UI framework like JSF is used. Binding domain objects with UI fields directly creates a mess inside domain classes because of UI only fields added. To prevent such problems, it's better to employ a separate model, specific to the UI layer. Such a separate model is employed to convert data obtained from back, and deliver it to the UI layer for presentation. UI components are bound to view model objects so that user input is first accumulated into those objects and delivered to back when appropriate. However, creating such a view model mainly overlaps with persistent domain model, and job of handling data transformations between two model is a tedious task. We propose a solution based on dynamic proxies to create view model classes automatically and an API to handle various tasks occur during those data transformations. We will present our solution and discuss about the API evolved over time."
#         long:
#           - "In todays world, layered architecture is a very common approach among enterprise applications. Each layer has a specific task of its own, and each one is only allowed to speak just one below. For example, data access layer deals with querying and persistence of data, service layer coordinates business operations and interacts with data access layer, presentation layer handles rendering of suitable user interface as well as processing user requests while talking with service layer. In this picture, data transfer throughout the layers is achieved using domain objects. For example, data is fetched from target datastore, then transformed into domain objects in data access layer, and delivered to the presentation layer for rendering purposes. In a similar way, domain objects bound to UI are filled with user input, then passed into backend layers for processing."
#           - "However, employing same domain classes in every layer can cause some data related problems in those applications. One might see that data might get inserted, updated or deleted unintentionally, especially when an ORM tool, like Hibernate is used for persisting data, UI frameworks like JSF or Vaadin, in which state management is handled on server side, while domain objects are directly bound to user interface components, used to collect user input and deliver it to the backend. Moreover, employing domain objects UI interaction might cause several fields and methods which are only needed by presentation layer get added into them. For example, adding a selected field and its corresponding getter/setter is a very common issue in order to identify which rows are selected in a UI table. That 'selected' property has nothing to the with the domain model at all."
#           - "In order to prevent such data integrity problems, and keep domain classes clean from UI specific attributes and methods, one needs to create and use a separate model targeted to the presentation layer. It may appear with different names, like 'data transfer object', 'data value object' or 'view model' in different projects, and whatever you call it for, its main duty is to prevent direct interaction and manipulation of domain objects via user interface components."
#           - "Although, we take it as a separate model, view model classes mostly overlap with domain model classes. Indeed, domain model classes can easily be transformed into view model classes with some additions of fields and methods. Actually, it becomes a burden for developers to just create and use a second set of model classes which are almost identical to domain model.
#           We propose a solution to automatically derive those view model classes from domain model classes using proxy pattern, and define an API to handle various data related tasks which occur while transforming domain objects into view model objects, apply those user changes occurred in those view model objects during UI interaction back again to domain instances etc. With the help of such an automatic view model creation mechanism, task of creating view model classes manually becomes unnecessary. In addition, view model – domain model back and forth transformations and data related operations can be performed easily through a standard API. In this session, I am going to talk about how to employ dynamic proxy class generation to obtain view model out of domain model classes, and discuss view model API in detail."

This talk is intentionally polemical and presents only one side of the story."

#           - "As distributed systems are becoming the norm, more demand rises for tools and methods for reliably building such systems. However, there is no silver bullet and just adopting a tool, technology or model does not make it easy to build reliable distributed systems. The actor based model existed since the 70s, but its popularity rose just in the last decade thanks to Erlang and Akka. As the actor model is adopted by more developers so are the misconceptions related to it. These misconceptions arise from marketing material and a general lack of understanding of distributed systems theory."
#           - "In this presentation we will analyse and debunk some myths that are typically attributed to the actor model such as:"
#           - "1. ease of development"

#           - "3. the readability of the code"

Methods like ad-hoc correctness proofs, temporal logic and model checking have been used for decades, but have always had downsides which prevented them from going mainstream. In this workshop we build on the theory presented in 'why are actors terrible' and teach a more efficient and effective method for building testable actor based systems. The approach presented uses some properties of the actor model and builds on TDD, property based testing and model checking in order to allow effective testing of distributed systems."
#           - "The workshop will include some hands on development using java+akka (or scala+akka if preferred). Attendees will have to use their laptops or work in pairs. We will try to build and test a correct implementation of a simple distributed algorithm such as the two phase commit. Ideally it should be 4 hours but we can adapt. Attendees will learn how to take advantage of the benefits of the actor model."

We also read code - doing white box testing, seeing did our colleagues missed something or added something extra. We also try to manage risk, point out risky parts of applications and ways to mitigate those. Testers care about performance by helping developers build the software in the way that it is optimized and fast, we don't just measure the response times. The same goes for security. Also, we are helping developers to get wider picture of the impact of their code on the whole system. In couple of word - we help a lot. Either by investigating the quality of the code delivered, or by clarifying the requirements, and sometimes creating specification, if the team is missing it. What you will learn from this presentation: 1. Why do you need testing? 2. What can a good tester do for you and your team? 3. How proper testing can be organized 4. What to expect from your testers ( when you hire them) 5. What to look in a tester during hiring process."

With distributed nature of microservices and REST API being the most prevalent inter-service interface, we are faced with some challenges in choosing the right approach to authentication and authorization mechanisms. We will look into most popular SSO mechanisms, like SAML2, OAuth2 and JWT. We will look into pros and cons of these choices."
#         long:
#           - "Microservices are one possible architectural choice when building scalable systems. With microservices we build many small components, focused on business use-cases, with clear interfaces between services. Components are designed to work in orchestration, each one being a part of the team, with most commonly used interface being REST API. With this in mind, we are faced with a challenge of implementing a security system that can follow this chosen architecture, without becoming a bottleneck. Also, the choice of REST API, as a specialization of HTTP protocol narrows down possible solutions to the problem."
#           - "In this talk we will first cover some theoretical aspects of security architectures. With security systems mostly focused on Identification, Authentication and Authorization, we will look into different implementations of security systems regarding these aspects."
#           - "Authentication systems will be roughly divided into three categories:"
#           - " "
#           - "*Local (local user store)"
#           - "*Distributed (NAS, LDAP, SQL-based)"
#           - "*Delegated (Kerberos, OAuth2, SAML2)"
#           - "Authorization is a process of deciding whether some action upon some target, by some entity, should be allowed. Authorization systems can roughly be divided into two groups:"
#           - " "
#           - "*Target based (UNIX DAC, ACL,...)"
#           - "*Subject based (RBAC, entitlements)"
#           - "With this in mind and having microservices as platform to apply security to, we are faced with a challenge of choosing the right architecture, so that we harnes and not hinder the power of our chosen platform. We will argue that the best choice for the microservices architecture is delegated or token-based authentication. Given the most prevalent inter-service interface is REST API, we will look into OAuth2, SAML2 and OAuth2/JWT as authentication-authorization mechanism. With that in mind, we will show differences in authorization when using these three mechanisms. We will show some examples of using OAuth2 + JWT as token-based mechanism and see pros and cons of each approach. SAML2 being similar in some aspects to JWT will be briefly mentioned."

#         long:
#           - "Containers are revolutionizing the way we deploy and maintain our infrastructures: reducing development overhead, streamlining dev / test / ops, and enabling highly scalable, dynamic infrastructures. But containers still have a key problem: monitoring and troubleshooting them is impractical, painful, and sometimes plain impossible. Even basic things like understanding what is using CPU, memory, or disk bandwidth inside a container are difficult - let alone finding out who a container is talking to on the network or tracking malicious activity. This presentation covers the current state of the art for container monitoring and visibility, including real use-cases and pros / cons of each."
#           - "The focus is on advanced container visibility techniques, such as:"
#           - "* visualizing a container’s network activity"
#           - "* understanding detailed resource usage (CPU, memory and disk I/O) of containers and individual processes running inside containers"
#           - "* following process and user activity inside containers"
#           - "* collecting logs from multiple containers"
#           - "The presentation features live interaction with container environments and live demos of all the tools and techniques discussed. Special emphasis is put on sysdig, an open source container and system troubleshooting tool."

#         long:
#           - "In the recent years we've seen a rising interest of the industry for virtual reality (VR) and lately for augmented reality (AR) as well. No wonder since it's the closest thing to holograms we've been dreaming of and drooling over in works of fiction for the past five decades or so. While VR brings 'total' immersion and a set of problems caused by it, AR promises future full of holograms all around us, our physical and virtual worlds finally collided and merged. It’s hard to even imagine, let alone predict all the ways it will affect content creation, user experience and overall interaction with the world around us. Advancements in processing power of mobile platforms and image sensors fueled this recent surge of interest towards AR, but there is still a long road ahead of us from having contact lens-like, inconspicuous AR devices capable of rendering augmentation indistinguishable from the reality."
#           - "This talk will focus more on some of the techniques used behind AR: computer vision algorithms, its usage in combination with computer graphics to achieve digital augmentation and evolution from simple marker-based and natural feature tracking to utilizing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Basically, what it takes to come from matrix of bytes received from image sensor to superimposing another matrix of computer generated bytes that our eyes perceive as augmented reality."
