# 404

So many years have passed since first you sought \\
the lands beyond the edges of the sky, \\
so many moons reflected in your eye, \\
since first you sought, and failed, and learned to fall,\\
and last, in glory gold and red around \\
your greatest search, your final quest to know!\\
yet... ashes drift, the embers cease to glow,\\
and darkened life in frozen death is drowned;\\
and ashes on the swell are seen no more.\\
The silence surges. Error 404.
