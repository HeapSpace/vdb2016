					<h4>Taxi</h4>
	        For the use of taxi services from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to any destination in Belgrade area and further, please contact the city service TAXI INFO desk, located in the baggage reclaim area. If this one is not working, there is one located immediately after you exit the baggage reclaim area, right next to the exit door.
					<br><br>
					Just be aware NOT taking the taxi from anyone who approaches you – they usually charge much more. Please take a taxi receipt at the information desk – it should state your end destination in Belgrade and the ride price. The price is fixed (1800 dinars for any location in the city center). See more info about the taxi <span class="accent"><a href="http://www.beg.aero/en/strana/8871" target="_blank">here</a></span>.

	      <div class="block-text">
					<h4>Minibus</h4>
	        A1 is the only bus taking passengers right from the Airport to the city center. This bus has a couple of stops before it reaches its final destination, Square Slavija. Slavija is well-connected with the rest of the city and you can use the public transport or a taxi from there.
					<br><br>
					The price for the ride is 150rsd (~1.2 euros).

	        There is only one BusPlus ticket for every type of transport. You can buy them at any paper store in the town. They are pre-paid, hence you need to buy a BusPlus card (once) and then fill it up with the amount you want. One ride is 89 dinars, so you can fill it up with e.g. 500din if you plan to use it!.
